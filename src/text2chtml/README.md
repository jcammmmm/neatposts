# About
The script `tex2chtml-page` was taken from the [MathJax](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-demos-node) demos node repositoy; a well curated and detailed repo devoted to examples on how to use MathJax in a node environment. In particular, this script was taken from the `jdom` examples.   
The current app makes use of [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) because the default one [liteDOM](https://github.com/litejs/dom) cannot handle complex html files such as those that appear on this blogs.
